<h2> U -Net model</h2>

U-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically designed for image segmentation tasks. It's particularly well-suited for biomedical image analysis, but it can be applied to various other image segmentation problems.


<h3>Key Features of U-Net:</h3>

<h3>Encoder-Decoder Architecture:</h3>
 U-Net consists of two main parts:
<h4>Encoder</h4> (Contracting Path): This part of the network downsamples the input image, capturing high-level features.
<h4>Decoder</h4> (Expanding Path): This part upsamples the features from the encoder, gradually reconstructing the original image while incorporating spatial information.
<h4>Skip Connections</h4> U-Net incorporates skip connections between corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder. These connections help preserve fine-grained details and prevent the loss of information during the upsampling process.
<h4>Symmetric Architecture</h4> The encoder and decoder parts of U-Net are roughly symmetric, ensuring that the network can effectively learn both high-level and low-level features.
<h3>Applications of U-Net</h3>

<h4>Medical Image Analysis<h4/> Segmenting organs, tumors, and other structures in medical images.
<h4>Cell Tracking</h4> Identifying and tracking individual cells in microscopy images.
<h4>Remote Sensing</h4>: Analyzing satellite images for land cover classification, object detection, and change detection.
<h4>Autonomous Driving</h4>: Segmenting road lanes, pedestrians, and other objects in images captured by vehicle cameras.
Advantages of U-Net:

 Efficient: U-Net is computationally efficient compared to other segmentation architectures.
Accurate: It has demonstrated excellent performance in various image segmentation tasks.
Versatile: U-Net can be adapted to different image sizes and segmentation problems.

<h1>You Only Look Once (YOLO)</h1>
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection system. Unlike traditional object detection methods that scan images multiple times,  YOLO divides an image into a grid and predicts both bounding boxes and class probabilities for each cell in a single pass.  This makes it significantly faster than other methods. YOLO is known for its speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.
